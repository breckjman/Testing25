        They're Pinky and The Brain
        Yes Pinky and The Brain
        One is a genius
        The other's insane

        They're laboratory mice
        Their genes have been spliced
        They're dinky
        They're Pinky and The Brain, Brain, Brain, Brain
        Brain, Brain, Brain, Brain
        Brain

        Before each night is done
        Their plan will be unfurled
        By the dawning of the sun
        They'll take over the world

        They're Pinky and The Brain
        Yes Pinky and The Brain
        Their twilight campaign
        Is easy to explain

        To prove their mousey worth
        They'll overthrow the Earth
        They're dinky
        They're Pinky and The Brain, Brain, Brain, Brain
        Brain, Brain, Brain, Brain
